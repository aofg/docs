Our primary focus at Age of Guilds has always been on development. Without an amazing product, nothing else ultimately matters. 

In an open source project such as Age of Guilds, advancing the codebase as well as content to the next level requires help from the wider community. 

With our Development and Content Bounty Program anyone can participate and earn rewards for contributions in Age of Guilds.

This page contains explanation of global Bounty Program, but more specific details described in corresponding section of development pipelines:
* [Server Development Bounty Program](/en/contribute/server/motivation.md)
* [Client Development Bounty Program](/en/contribute/client/motivation.md)
* [Content Bounty Program](/en/contribute/content/motivation.md)

| Decompile on a collection of atomic tasks | `3 * count` | anyone |
| Set a complexity of tasks (from 1 to 5) | `100 / tasks / votes` | contributors |
