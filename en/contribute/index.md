**Age of Guilds** is a community developed, massive multiplayer role playing game, where players assume the role in a group of players to contribute to guild success. Together (as a group) they must keep the guild healthy, whilst dealing with antagonistic forces (NPCs as well as other players) who threaten to sabotage the mission.

Developing a project of this scale is a complex task. Smart enough to take it apart to development pipelines:
* [Server engineering](/en/contribute/server/index.md)
* [Client development](/en/contribute/client/index.md)
* [Content production](/en/contribute/content/index.md)
