## List of works what should be done
Each game needs a content and AOFG isn't an exception. 
In a final state AOFG requires a lot of:
- [Deep thoughtful story][1]
- [Nice looking character outfit][2]
- [Smoothly animations][3]
- [Great environment][4]
- [Special effects][5] (FX)
- [Atmospheric music][6]
- [Sharp and clean sounds][7] 

To come to the final state we should pass through whole pipeline:
- [Lore] — core setup of story and world
- [Design] — detailed book of rules
- [Research] — search and analysis the data (ex. the history of religions)
- [References] — collecting and structuring examples from other projects 
- [Sketches] — process of finding the perfect shape and volume
- [Concept Arts] — visual rules for continues works
- [Promo artworks] — drawing artworks for promotion 

#### Feel free to contribute as much as you can (any kind of help is welcome)
